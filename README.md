# Overview

This repo contains project related to big data problems. These problems can be categorized as the four V's
- Volume
	- Amount of samples
	- High dimensional data or amount of features/predictors
- Velocity
	- Process/analyse data within a certain speed
- Variety
	- Able to process all kinds of data (i.e *Unstructed data* which consists of videos or audio files)
- Veracity
	- Able to deal with uncertainty in data
	- In accuracy in the data in terms of mislabeling

Each project will most likely be a somewhat short jupyter notebook that will go over experimental results rather than building large systems that deal with big data.
